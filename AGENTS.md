## Repository Guidelines

- Use **pnpm** for dependency management and scripts.
- Run `pnpm test` to execute the test suites across all packages before committing changes.
- Prefer TypeScript for new code and keep existing modules typed.
- Add or update tests alongside code changes when applicable.
